        <h2>Get off to a good start</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Your first meal of the day is an important one.</p>
        <p>According to an article published in Harvard Health Letter, eating breakfast regularly has been linked to a lower risk of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Starting your day with a healthy meal can help replenish your blood sugar, which your body needs to power your muscles and brain.

            Eating a healthy breakfast is especially important on days when exercise is on your agenda. Skipping breakfast can leave you feeling lightheaded or lethargic while you're working out.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Choosing the right kind of breakfast is crucial. Too many people rely on simple carbohydrates to start their day. A plain white bagel or doughnut won't keep you feeling full for long.

                In comparison, a fiber- and protein-rich breakfast may fend off hunger pangs for longer and provide the energy you need to keep your exercise going.</p>
                <hr><p>Follow these tips for eating a healthy breakfast:</p><hr>
                <ul>
                    <li>Instead of eating sugar-laden cereals made from refined grains, try oatmeal, oat bran, or other whole-grain cereals that are high in fiber. Then, throw in some protein, such as milk, yogurt, or chopped nuts.</li>
                    <li>If you're making pancakes or waffles, replace some of the all-purpose flour with whole-grain options. Then, stir some cottage cheese into the batter.</li>
                    <li>If you prefer toast, choose whole-grain bread. Then pair it with an egg, peanut butter, or another protein source.</li>
                </ul> <hr>
