      <h2>Role of AI in Business</h2>
      <p class="headline">
        In business, artificial intelligence (AI) is more than just a trend;
        it's a crucial tool reshaping how we approach marketing and customer
        engagement. According to our research, nearly 9 out of 10 business
        leaders are gearing up to boost their investments in AI and machine
        learning (ML), especially in marketing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Why this surge? At the heart of this AI revolution is the ability to
        segment behaviors and target specific customer groups with precision.
        It's about making smarter decisions, crafting more personalized
        strategies and understanding customer needs on a deeper level, all of
        which are crucial across various business units.

        This article will explore the diverse roles AI plays in enhancing
        business functions like marketing, operations, product development,
        human resources, customer support and security. Each domain benefits
        from AI's ability to streamline processes, improve efficiency, and
        provide actionable insights, making every interaction and decision more
        meaningful and effective.<blockquote class="quote">“Artificial intelligence would be the ultimate version of Google. The ultimate search engine that would understand everything on the web. It would understand exactly what you wanted, and it would give you the right thing. We're nowhere near doing that now. However, we can get incrementally closer to that, and that is basically what we work on.”<cite></cite> —Larry Page</cite></blockquote>

        cognitive functions by machines. It includes a wide range of
        technologies that enable machines to perform tasks traditionally
        requiring human intelligence, such as reasoning, problem-solving,
        decision-making, and learning from experience.
