      Nigeria was granted independence on October 1, 1960. A new constitution
      established a federal system with an elected prime minister and a
      ceremonial head of state. The NCNC, now headed by <span><a id="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nnamdi_Azikiwe">Azikiwe</a></span> (who had taken
      control after Macaulay’s death in 1946), formed a coalition with Balewa’s
      NPC after neither party won a majority in the 1959 elections. Balewa
      continued to serve as the prime minister, a position he had held since
      1957, while Azikiwe took the largely ceremonial position of president of
      the Senate.</p> 
      <p>Following a UN-supervised referendum, the northern part of the
      Trust Territory of the Cameroons joined the Northern region in June 1961,
      while in October the Southern Cameroons united with Cameroun to form the
      Federal Republic of Cameroon. On October 1, 1963, Nigeria became a
      republic. Azikiwe became president of the country, although as prime
      minister Balewa was still more powerful.</p> <br>

      <p>Lieut. Col. (later Gen.) Yakubu Gowon came to power. The crisis was compounded by intercommunal clashes in the north and threats of secession in the south.</p>
      <p>Gowon’s attempt to hold a conference to settle the constitutional future of Nigeria was abandoned after a series of ethnic massacres in October. A last-ditch effort to save the country was made in January 1967, when the Eastern delegation, led by Lieut. Col. (later Gen.) Odumegwu Ojukwu, agreed to meet the others on neutral ground at Aburi, Ghana, but the situation deteriorated after differences developed over the interpretation of the accord. In May the Eastern region’s consultative assembly authorized Ojukwu to establish a sovereign republic, while, at the same time, the federal military government promulgated a decree dividing the four regions into 12 states, including 6 in the north and 3 in the east, in an attempt to break the power of the regions.</p>

    <h2>The Civil War</h2>
    <p>On May 30, 1967, Ojukwu declared the secession of the three states of the Eastern region under the name of the Republic of Biafra, which the federal government interpreted as an act of rebellion. Fighting broke out in early July and within weeks had escalated into a full-scale civil war. In August Biafran troops crossed the Niger, seized Benin City, and were well on their way to Lagos before they were checked at Ore, a small town in Western state (now Ondo state). </p>
