    The factors of production are the inputs used to produce a good or service
    in order to produce income.
  </p>
  <p>
    Economists define four factors of production: land, labor, capital and
    entrepreneurship. These can be considered the building blocks of an economy.
    How these factors are combined determines the success or failure of the
    outcome.
  </p>
  <p>
    "The four factors of production are needed in an efficient market to provide
    goods and services at an affordable price at the right time, place and mix,"
    says Bob Castaneda, program director for Walden University's Master of
    Science in Finance. "Missing the calibration of these factors can be
    disastrous for the supplier and consumer." The supplier may face higher
    costs of production, forcing them to charge a higher price to the consumer
    or risk going out of business.
  </p>
  <p>
    An example Castaneda uses to illustrate the importance of the four factors
    of production is when Ray Kroc bought McDonald's (ticker: MCD) and then
    found himself lacking capital, land and entrepreneurs to open new stores. To
    remedy this, Kroc created a franchise model that brought all three of these
    factors together.
  </p>
  <p>
    A key element of the factors of production is their scarcity. "The
    availability, quality and costs of these factors affect costs of production,
    R&D spending and market potential," says Usha Haley, director of the Center
    of International Business Advancement at Wichita State University's Barton
    School of Business. "They contribute to rents, wages, interest rates, and
    capacities for innovation and in that fashion are important for investors to
    understand."
  </p>
  <p>
    Here is a closer look at each of the four factors of production and how they
    come together to impact the financial markets:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Land</li>
    <li>Labour</li>
    <li>Capital</li>
    <li>Entrepreneurship</li>
  </ul>

  <div id="land"><h2>LAND</h2></div>
  <hr />
  <p>
    Land as a factor of production includes the natural resources used to create
    a good or service. These can be renewable resources like forests or
    nonrenewable resources like oil, gold or water, says Edward Petersmarck,
    executive director of practice development at M&O Marketing.
  </p>
  <p>
    The U.S. is advantaged in terms of land as a factor of production. The
    third-largest nation by geography, America is home to an abundance of
    natural resources, including more than 750 million acres of forest, nearly
    2.3 billion acres of agricultural land and the largest supply of coal,
    natural gas and petroleum. Other nations may have similar land mass but are
    unable to access these resources as readily due to harsher climates.
  </p>
  <p>
    An interesting facet of land as a factor of production is how use is
    influenced by the capital markets. "Tax schemes can heavily influence the
    land component and where people do business," McIntyre says. "For example,
    Tesla moving out of California to Texas."
  </p>
  <p>
    Similarly, many companies and people have been moving out of urban areas due
    to the pandemic. "One of the key advantages of urban areas was the
    centralized transportation system," McIntyre says. "If you're working from
    home, that advantage is diminished."
  </p>
  <div id="labour"><h3>LABOUR</h3></div>
  <hr />
  <p>
    "When we think about the factors of production, the one we are most focused
    on is labor," says John Traynor, chief investment officer of People's United
    Advisors. Labor is the work done by the people in a workforce. Its value is
    dependent on the human capital, or the skills, knowledge, training and
    experience of these workers.
  </p>
  <p>
    "So many of the topics being debated today in the political and economic
    spheres revolve around human capital and finding ways to increase
    productivity for all workers," Traynor says. Increasing the factors of
    production used in creating a good can increase production, but it is the
    more efficient use of those factors "that leads to greater productivity and
    rising living standards," he adds.
  </p>
  <p>
    Traynor gives the classic example of a team of men digging a trench with
    shovels. An entrepreneur can invest in a bulldozer to speed production, but
    if he doesn't teach the men how to use it, all he has is "men with shovels
    and a costly lawn ornament." Thanks to inventions like bulldozers, labor has
    been disadvantaged by increasing productivity, as fewer workers are required
    to create the same amount of output. Similarly, globalization has placed
    increasing pressure on domestic labor forces to compete with outsourcing
    opportunities.
  </p>
  <div id="capital"><h4>CAPITAL</h4></div>
  <hr />
  <p>
    Capital as a factor of production refers to capital goods, or man-made
    resources, such as tools and infrastructure, used in the production of a
    good or service. Petersmarck gives examples such as a craftsman's hammer or
    a doctor's MRI machine. It is not to be confused with money, which he says
    "can buy capital but is not used to produce capital."
  </p>
  <p>
    Capital goods can also be distinguished from consumer goods in that capital
    goods are used for production, while consumer goods are used for
    consumption. For example, a business complex is a capital good, while an
    apartment complex is a consumer good. Capital naturally varies based on the
    industry and workforce. Capital for the construction industry may include a
    jackhammer and bulldozer, for instance.
  </p>
  <div id="entrepreneurship"><h5>Entrepreneurship</h5></div>
  <hr />
  <p>
    Entrepreneurs are the people who combine the other factors of production -
    land, labor and capital-to generate profit. You can think back to McDonald's
    franchiser Ray Kroc as an example of the entrepreneurial factor of
    production.
  </p>
  <p>
    "Entrepreneurial activity is the engine of innovation that brings new ways
    of organizing land, capital and labor to produce new goods and services,"
    says Luis Portes, professor of economics at Montclair State University.
    Global events can also impact entrepreneurial success. For example,
    "post-9/11 there was a spike in companies focused on security," McIntyre
    says. "Now, with the pandemic, there's an uptick in medical-focused
    companies."
