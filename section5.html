    <div><h2>Buying of Used Cars</h2>
    <p>If you are in the market for a new car, finding options is very simple. All you need to do is open a new search
        window and type in “cars for sale near me”. Alternatively, you can look at sites that specialise in reselling
        used cars, such as Cars45, to name just one!</p>
        <p>But finding a used car to buy is easy, The hard part is knowing what to look out for to ensure you find the best
        deal for the best price.If you are looking for top tips for choosing your best first car or you have already
        purchased a vehicle or two, and are looking to brush up on the basics, here are seven things to look out for
        when buying a car.</p> 
        <p> Take your time walking around the cars exterior, looking for any scratches, dents, or rust.
        There is no need to be overly concerned about small dings or scratches, which are to be expected with a used car
        (and hopefully the owner will have taken them into consideration when naming the price). You should be on the
        lookout for large amounts of rust or body panels that dont line up evenly, as that may indicate that the
        vehicle was in an accident and not repaired correctly. Open and close the doors, bonnet, and boot to check their mobility — look for any awkwardness or stiffness which
        again, might indicate they were damaged and only partially repaired. </p>
        <p>There will be at least a <time datetime="30 mins">30 minutes</time> test drive for proper inspection of the cars</p>
