            <h1>Judiciary System in Nigeria

            <p>Nigeria's court system begins with various local and district courts; continues with appellate and high courts; and culminates with the Supreme Court of Nigeria. All other courts must adhere to the rulings that are administered by the Nigerian Supreme Court, and no other judicial body has the power to overturn their decisions.

        <h2>The Supreme Court.
       
        <p>
            The Supreme Court has original jurisdiction in any dispute between the Federation and a state or between states and also has appellate jurisdiction to hear and determine appeals from the Court of Appeal. The Supreme Court of Nigeria consists of the Chief Justice of Nigeria and such number of Justices of the Supreme Court, not exceeding twenty-one, as may be prescribed by an Act of the National Assembly. Presently the Supreme Court is made up of the Chief Justice and twenty (20) other Justices.

        <h4>Federal High Court.
        <p>The Federal High Court as a premier Court of first instance has recorded impressive growth since its inception in 1973 and has become, unarguably an important pillar among the Courts in the Federal Judiciary of Nigeria. From the pioneering Five Judges, the Court now has over eighty (80) Judges. The Court has also grown structurally in terms of opening new Divisions in almost all the States of the Federation with Lagos state and Delta with two divisions having regard to the volume of cases filed there.</p></h4>
