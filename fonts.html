    <h2>The plot</h2>
    <p>
      The trailer and teaser materials for Jagun Jagun were enough to spark
      national raves and anticipation among viewers. The two-minute trailer
      promised viewers an epic action experience that would keep them on the
      edges of their seats. Judging by the film’s number one position on Netflix
      Nigeria’s trending list and its 4th position on Netflix UK’s trending
      list, it’s safe to say that it delivers to a certain extent.
    </p>

    <p>
      Jagun Jagun lays a precedent for what Nollywood producers should consider
      if they decide to produce an epic film. The Tope Adebayo and Adebayo
      Tijani co-directed film takes the execution of stunts, production designs,
      and acting performances to a whole new level, immersing viewers in a
      fictional world where they most likely don’t want to leave after two hours
      and fourteen minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      After many training sessions, Gbotija is sent out to fight in a war.
      Things go south as the warriors on the battlefield are primarily young and
      inexperienced. Angered by the decision of the group leaders to hide away
      while the war was being waged, Ogunjimi sends out a spiritual assassin,
      Agemo, and punishes the absent officials by depriving them of food and
      freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another warrior, Wehinwo (Adeoye Adeyemi Elesho), goes against Ogunjimi’s
      command and gives food to the officials, leading to his death. News of his
      demise reaches home, infuriating his fiancee, who consults with a
      herbalist to kill Ogunjimi’s wife (Fathia Balogun).
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, Gbotija saves her, thus earning respect among other group
      members. Gbotija’s popularity soon reaches the ears of Ogunjimi, who
      becomes jealous and decides to kill two birds with one stone. After a
      high-ranking officer, Gbogunmi (Ibrahim Yekini Itele), in his group
      rejects his command, he proposes that Gbotija fights to the death with
      Gboogunmi. Gbotija later experiences a bitter win.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the promise of a promotion, Gbotija undergoes several challenges. On
      his final challenge, he realises that he’s being played. It leads to a
      confrontation with Ogunjimi, where only one can come out alive.
    </p>
    <h3>The Good</h3>
    <p>
      Jagun Jagun boasts a good script. One can quickly tell that several
      thoughts, editing, and reviews went into the scripting as every event and
      scene contributed to the film’s endgame. It was refreshing to watch a
      movie mostly void of irrelevant scenes that would leave viewers wondering,
      “What was that for?” The twists and turns were another favourite part of
      the script, as many were unpredictable. Even when it was obvious that
      Gbotimi would eventually betray Ogunjimi, viewers were in the dark about
      how such an event would happen.
    </p>
    <h3>The Bad</h3>
    <p>
      Firstly, the editing and visual effects. Although, understandably, the
      Nigerian film industry is slowly incorporating special effects into
      movies, the use of a few in Jagun Jagun comes off as undone. A good
      example is the first scene where Ogunjim chops off a man’s hand; one could
      quickly tell that it was fake as there was a disparity between the hand
      and background.
    </p>
    <p>
      In terms of editing, the texts come under fire. Many transitions felt
      seamless, while a few appeared as cut and join. Secondly, what happened to
      Ogunjimi? Characters kept referring to Ogunjimi as a fearsome and ruthless
      warlord, but viewers were stripped of the opportunity to witness his fury
      until the end. It would have been great to watch Ogunjimi fight in wars,
      punishing his enemies ruthlessly.
    </p>
    <h4>Final Verdict</h4>
    <p>
      Watch it. Even though Jagun Jagun bears similarities to films like King of
      Thieves and Orisa, it raises the bar for Nigerian epic movies.
      Jagun Jagun is streaming on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.netflix.com/ng/title/81681240">Netflix</a>
